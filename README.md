# ticktacktoe
Easy project to make ticktacktoe game

Data structures being used:
Linked List

This game will be played in the terminal I will create this project in C++ and python in preperation for technical interviews.

An extension of the game can be to add a UI and make it a web app with the same back in as before.

Final extensiion would be to make it avalible to play online with other people on the server we would want to keep track of total wins and W/L ratio.
